# GymBuddy


# Description
GymBuddy is a full-stack application that will ask the user questions, then compare their answers with those from other users.

## API

Heroku is used to host the application. At the bottom of the main page and survey page there is an  **API Friends List**  button. Once the button is clicked it will display a JSON of all possible friends that have taken the survey.

## This is the GymBuddy for you!

After all surveys have been answered and the user clicks the submit button, the application will calculate the differences of the user input to other friends that have answered the same questions. A screen will appear showing the name and photo of the friend that had the least amount of difference from the user.
